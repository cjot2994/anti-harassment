Noisebridge's Anti-Harrassment Policy
=====================================

This is a place for Noisebridge to collaborate on our anti-harassment
policy during the three-month-ish provisional period. File issues and
make pull requests, but please don't merge your own changes.

=====================================

Noisebridge is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or
space in any form.

Sexual language and imagery should be only be used for positive
purposes in accordance with best practices advocated by professional
sex educators (if you’re not sure what those are, don’t do it).

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

People violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
space or the event at the discretion of any Noisebridge member.
